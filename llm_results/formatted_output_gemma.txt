# Context: 

The committee recommends the following: 1. To implement a whole-of-government approach to AI Governance, MeitY and the Principal Scientific Adviser should establish an empowered mechanism to coordinate AI Governance. The empowered mechanism should be in the form of an Inter-Ministerial AI Coordination Committee or Governance Group (Committee/ Group). It should bring together the various authorities and institutions that deal with AI Governance at the national level. The Committee/ Group should have an ongoing status and should not be a limited duration mechanism. The overall purpose of this Committee/ Group should be to bring the key institutions around a common roadmap and to coordinate their efforts to implement a whole-of government approach. A collaborative and co-ordinated approach by various regulators can enable them to be more efficient and effective, given the complexity likely to be involved in dealing with AI systems at scale, especially when we take a long-term view of the diffusion stage of their lifecycle. This can be especially necessary in domains and areas where multiple authorities may be concerned (e.g., consumer protection, food, transportation, agriculture, health care, etc.). The Committee/ Group should enable a whole of government approach to the AI ecosystem. Currently, regulators and government departments may have some visibility on the AI systems developed or deployed by entities who are under sectoral regulation (e.g., finance or health) or where the market is concentrated (e.g., ecommerce, social media, aggregators). However, the level of visibility would need to be adequate to assess potential risks associated with such entities in the context of AI. Further, there are likely to be AI systems developed or being developed and/ or deployed by entities who may not have an interface with the government/ regulators from a perspective of affording suitable visibility to enable a risk assessment in relation to AI. A pre-requisite of governance would be for the government and the regulators to have a credible understanding the AI ecosystem in the country so that governance measures are rooted to the realities of existing and likely risks. The Committee/ Group should facilitate this task. This would require a conversation-led approach with a view to develop an understanding of the ecosystem which can both serve as feedback for strengthening governance and enable understanding of possible challenges and gaps in complying Page 13 of 22 and enforcing existing laws. It is important to emphasise that such a mapping exercise should not result in regulatory overreach through at scale registration and reporting requirements. With the above context, the Committee/ Group should meet at a regular basis to suggest measures to catalyse collaboration between departments and regulators, so that they can: • apply and strengthen existing laws to minimise risk of harm due to use of AI; • provide legal clarity and certainty around development and use of AI by issuing joint guidance; • harmonise existing efforts and initiatives around common terminologies and risk inventories; • enable demonstrable self-regulation to operationalise the responsible AI principles; • take coordinated steps to respond to identified gaps with the benefit of multiregulatory support; • create a policy environment which enables the use of AI for beneficial use-cases; and • promote the development and deployment of responsible AI applications in their domains/sectors. In order to enable appropriate measurement of fairness, accountability and transparency in the Indian context, it is an essential prerequisite to have access to the right datasets, relevant to the Indian context, which allows users to assess the fairness and bias of their models across standard datasets. The creation of better datasets for the Indian context should be stimulated, and sector-specific datasets should be identified to enable creation and evaluation of fair models. These initiatives may be encouraged by the Committee/ Group. The Committee/ Group should have a mix of both official and non-official members, because such a forum focused on coordinating AI governance must also bring in external expertise from industry and academia, given their central role in operationalising responsible AI principles in practice. It may be headed by the Principal Scientific Adviser. Official members could include representatives deputed from MeitY, the NITI Aayog, the Telecommunication Engineering Centre, Bureau of Indian Standards, other departments of the Central Government, as well as sectoral regulators (e.g., RBI, Indian Council of Medical Research, SEBI, IRDAI, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, etc.). Non-official members could include persons capable of representing the interests of AI developers, AI deployers, data providers, data principals, and end-users – so that the perspectives of the overall ecosystem can be considered. The Committee/ Group should invite external experts for discussions to understand and take on board diverse perspectives.

**Question:** What is the primary objective of the proposed Inter-Ministerial AI Coordination Committee or Governance Group?

# Context: 

The need to enable effective compliance and enforcement of existing laws. 1. Deepfakes/ fakes/ malicious content There are existing legal safeguards/instruments to protect against misuse of foundation models for creating malicious synthetic media (i.e., malicious ‘deepfakes’). In this case, depending upon the context and negative effect of the malicious synthetic media in question, multiple laws can apply. For example: See: Rahul Matthan, The Zone of Mischief (2024) 8 Page 7 of 22 ● Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act): Section 66D of the IT Act criminalises the use of computer resources for cheating by personation. Section 66E prescribes the punishment for capturing and publishing or transmitting the image of a private area of any person without his or her consent. Publishing or transmitting obscene material for instance, which could be generated by using deepfake technology is a punishable offence under Section 67A and 67B of the IT Act. ● Indian Penal Code (IPC): In addition to the IT Act, certain harms/cybercrimes perpetuated by AI could also fall under the IPC. For instance, identity theft and cheating by personation are offences under Section 419 (cheating by personation), section 463 and 465 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), section 292 and 294 (selling/circulating/distributing obscene objects), and section 499 (causing harm to reputation/defamation). It is to be noted that the IPC has been recently replaced by the Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita (BNS2), and the BNS2 retains these offences. ● Other laws: In addition to the IT Act and IPC / BNS2, there could be more laws depending on the nature of crime or cause of actions involved, like Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (section 12) in the event of sexual harassment of children, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (section 75) for causing harm to the children, the Copyrights Act (section 51), if synthetic content infringes copyrighted work. It is worth noting that existing laws can also require specific measures from platforms and online service providers to detect and remove malicious synthetic media. Under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021: ● Rule 3(1)(b) requires intermediaries to inform its rules and regulations, privacy policy and user agreement to a user and to make reasonable efforts to prevent the dissemination of specific types of content, that may cause harm to its users – including information that may violate bodily privacy, cause harm to a child, is deceptive, among other things. ● Rule 3(1)(c) requires intermediaries to periodically inform their users about the effects of non-compliance with the rules and regulations, privacy policy, or user agreement of such intermediary. ● Rule 3(2)(b) requires the intermediary to, within 24 hours of receiving user complaint of content which is ‘impersonation in electronic form, including artificially morphed images of such individual’ remove or disable its access. Further, the grievance officer appointed by the intermediary should acknowledge user complaints within 24 hours. The above shows that the legal framework may be adequate for the purposes of detecting, preventing, removing, and prosecuting the creation and distribution of malicious synthetic media. However, for this legal framework to be effective, it needs to be backed by requisite capabilities to enable stakeholders to effectively comply and for the authorities to enforce the legal framework. Page 8 of 22 This area points to possible gaps and opportunities for using technological measures for enabling effective compliance, so that malicious deepfakes are detected in time and/ or are removed before they cause serious harm. For example, as suggested above, traceability may be established by assigning unique and immutable identities to different participants, such as content creators, publishers, social media platforms, etc. These may then be used to watermark inputs to, and outputs from, generative AI tools. These may be used to track and analyse the lifecycle, from creation to use, of a deepfake – and to determine when they have been cre

**Question:** How do the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the Indian Penal Code (or its replacement, BNS2) address cybercrimes related to deepfakes?

**LLM Answer:** The Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC) or its replacement, Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita (BNS2), address cybercrimes related to deepfakes through the following provisions:

**IT Act:**

* Section 66D criminalises the use of computer resources for cheating by personation.
* Section 66E prescribes punishment for capturing and publishing or transmitting the image of a private area of any person without their consent.
* Sections 67A and 67B criminalise the publishing or transmitting obscene material generated using deepfake technology.

**IPC/BNS2:**

* Sections 419 (cheating by personation), 463 and 465 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 292 and 294 (selling/circulating/distributing obscene objects) and 499 (causing harm to reputation/defamation) address offences related to identity theft, cheating, and defamation through deepfakes.

**Additional Provisions:**

* The IT Act and IPC/BNS2 require platforms and online service providers to:
    * Inform users about the risks of malicious synthetic media.
    * Detect and remove malicious synthetic media promptly.
    * Establish traceability measures by assigning unique identities to participants and watermarking AI tool outputs.

**Human Answer:** The Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act), addresses cybercrimes related to deepfakes through several sections:• Section 66D criminalizes the use of computer resources for cheating by personation. This could apply if a deepfake is used to impersonate someone for fraudulent purposes.• Section 66E prescribes punishment for capturing and publishing or transmitting the image of a private area of any person without their consent. Deepfakes creating such images could fall under this section.• Sections 67A and 67B make publishing or transmitting obscene material punishable offences1. This could include obscene content generated using deepfake technology. The Indian Penal Code (IPC) and its recent replacement, the Bharatiya Nyaya (Second) Sanhita (BNS2), also address harms and cybercrimes that could be perpetrated by AI-generated malicious synthetic media: • Section 419 (cheating by personation) of the IPC criminalizes identity theft and cheating by personation1. This offense is retained in the BNS2. •Sections 463 and 465 (forgery for the purpose of cheating) of the IPC address forgery with the intent to deceive1. These offences are also retained in the BNS2. • Sections 292 and 294 (selling/circulating/distributing obscene objects) of the IPC criminalize the dissemination of obscene material. These offences are retained in the BNS2. • Section 499 (causing harm to reputation/defamation) of the IPC addresses defamation1. This offence is also retained in the BNS2. •In addition to these, other laws like the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (section 12), can apply in cases of sexual harassment of children, and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 (section 75), for causing harm to children1. The Copyrights Act (section 51) may also be relevant if synthetic content infringes copyrighted work

    - Rules and regulations
    - Privacy policy
    - User agreement
* **Make reasonable efforts to prevent the dissemination of:**
    - Content that violates bodily privacy
    - Content that causes harm to a child
    - Deceptive content
* **Remove or disable access to content flagged as:**
    - Impersonation in electronic form, including artificially morphed images of such individual
Within 24 hours of receiving a user complaint concerning such content.

**Human Answer:** Under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, online intermediaries have specific obligations in detecting and removing malicious synthetic media: •Rule 3(1)(b) requires intermediaries to inform users of their rules, regulations, privacy policy, and user agreement and to make reasonable efforts to prevent the dissemination of specific types of harmful content. This includes information that may violate bodily privacy, cause harm to a child, or is deceptive. •Rule 3(1)(c) mandates that intermediaries periodically inform their users about the consequences of non-compliance with their rules, regulations, privacy policy, or user agreement. •Rule 3(2)(b) requires intermediaries to remove or disable access to content within 24 hours of receiving a user complaint regarding 'impersonation in electronic form, including artificially morphed images of such individual'. Furthermore, the grievance officer appointed by the intermediary must acknowledge user complaints within 24 hour.

**Question:** Why is technological intervention necessary for the effective enforcement of laws against malicious deepfakes?

**LLM Answer:** Technological intervention is necessary for the effective enforcement of laws against malicious deepfakes due to the following reasons:

**1. Rapid Evolution of Technology:**
- Deepfake technology is evolving rapidly, making traditional detection methods ineffective.
- New and more sophisticated deepfake creations emerge constantly, challenging the ability of law enforcement to keep pace.

**2. Difficulty in Detection:**
- Distinguishing between genuine and malicious deepfakes can be challenging, especially for non-experts.
- Automated tools are needed to analyze and identify patterns of manipulation.

**3. Traceability and Accountability:**
- Establishing traceability of deepfake creation and distribution is crucial for accountability.
- Technological measures can help assign unique identities and watermark content, enabling tracking throughout the lifecycle.

**4. Automated Detection and Removal:**
- Automated systems can analyze and remove malicious deepfakes promptly, reducing their harmful impact.
- This is especially important for platforms and online service providers to comply with regulatory guidelines.

**5. Capacity Building for Enforcement Agencies:**
- Technological interventions can provide law enforcement agencies with tools and training to effectively investigate and prosecute deepfake-related offenses.
- This includes enhancing their ability to analyze evidence and identify perpetrators.

**Human Answer:** While the existing legal framework may be adequate for detecting, preventing, removing, and prosecuting the creation and distribution of malicious synthetic media, technological intervention is necessary for its effective enforcement. This is because technological measures can enable stakeholders to effectively comply with the law, and authorities to enforce it by detecting malicious deepfakes in time and/or removing them before they cause serious harm.

**Question:** How can traceability and watermarking help in tracking and preventing the spread of harmful AI-generated content?

**LLM Answer:** **Traceability and watermarking can assist in tracking and preventing the dissemination of malicious AI-generated content by:**

**1. Establishing Unique Identifiers:**

* Assigning unique and immutable identities to participants in the AI content creation and distribution process (e.g., content creators, publishers, social media platforms).
* Watermarking inputs and outputs from generative AI tools with these identifiers.


**2. Tracking Content Lifecycle:**

* Tracking the entire lifecycle of a deepfake from creation to use.
* Identifying the source and propagation paths of malicious AI-generated content.


**3. Detecting Malicious Use:**

* Watermarking outputs from AI tools with contextual information, such as metadata and geolocation data.
* Establishing a baseline of legitimate AI-generated content to detect deviations.


**4. Enhancing Accountability:**

* Identifying individuals responsible for the creation and distribution of malicious AI-generated content.
* Facilitating legal enforcement actions by providing tangible evidence.


**5. Enhancing Platform Responsiveness:**

* Providing intermediaries with tools to identify and remove malicious AI-generated content promptly.
* Establishing clear accountability mechanisms for platform operators.


**6. Strengthening Legal Frameworks:**

* Establishing legal traceability measures as evidence in court.
* Enhancing the effectiveness of takedown requests and content moderation policies.

**Human Answer:** Traceability and watermarking are suggested as technological measures that can help in tracking and preventing the spread of harmful AI-generated content1. Establishing unique and immutable identities for participants such as content creators, publishers, and social media platforms, and using these to watermark inputs and outputs of generative AI tools, could allow for tracking and analyzing the lifecycle of a deepfake from creation to use. This can help in determining when harmful content has been created and disseminated.
